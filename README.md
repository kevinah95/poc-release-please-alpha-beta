# poc-release-please-alpha-beta

This is a proof of concept repository to demonstrate how to set up Google Release Please to create prereleases (alpha, beta, etc) on a separate branch (e.g., `beta`), while also maintaining stable releases on the `main` branch.

## Setup

1. **Create Branches**: Ensure you have the `main` branch for stable releases and a `beta` branch for beta prereleases.
